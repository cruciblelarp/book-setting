## FOREWORD
To you who are fortunate enough to have picked up a copy of this work
of mine and bearing in your heart I am sure the desire to peruse all that
I have compiled here to educate and enlighten you, I offer my warmest
wishes. What you shall find within the pages of this tome is indeed but a
mere trifling work compared to my various masterpieces, but I feel will
undoubtedly prove sufficient to introduce you to the fundamentals of
the world in which you dwell upon, the realms of humanity that you no
doubt belong to, and some of the more esoteric matters that you may be
in possession of a passing awareness of.

So please, enjoy reading what I have provided you with here, and should
your thirst for knowledge not be sated, then I would encourage you to
seek out my other works, undoubtedly found within all the finest literary
repositories in the world, and some human ones as well.
